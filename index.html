        <h2>Nature photography</h2>
        <p>
          Nature photography encompasses a wide range of photography taken
          outdoors and devoted to displaying natural elements such as
          landscapes, wildlife, plants, and close-ups of natural scenes and
          textures. Nature photography tends to place a stronger emphasis on the
          aesthetic value of the photo than other photography genres, such as
          photojournalism and documentary photography.

        <p>
          Cloudscape photography is a sub-genre of landscape photography that
          focuses on the sky and its cloud formations. It can be used to capture
          the beauty of the sky, as well as the changing weather conditions and
          their effects on the landscape. It can also be used to create abstract
          images that focus on the shapes and colors of the clouds.
